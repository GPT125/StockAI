        body: `The stock market is just a giant marketplace where people buy and sell tiny slices of companies. That's it. When you buy a share of Apple, you literally own a microscopic piece of Apple — and if Apple becomes more valuable, so does your slice.

**Why do companies sell shares?** To raise money. Instead of borrowing from a bank, they sell pieces of themselves to thousands of investors. In exchange, investors get a claim on future profits.

**Why do you care?** Because over the last 100 years, owning pieces of good businesses has been the single best way for regular people to build wealth. Better than savings accounts. Better than gold. Better than real estate for most people.`,

        body: `Compound interest is what makes investing powerful. Instead of earning money only on your original investment, you also earn money on the money your money already made.

**Example:** Start with $1,000 at 10% per year.
- Year 1: $1,100
- Year 10: $2,594
- Year 20: $6,727
- Year 30: $17,449
- Year 40: $45,259

You contributed only $1,000, but after 40 years it's worth **$45,000+** — and you did nothing.

**The lesson:** Time is the single most important variable in investing. Every year you wait is a year of exponential growth you'll never get back. Albert Einstein allegedly called compound interest "the eighth wonder of the world."`,

**1. Stocks** — a slice of ONE company. High risk, high reward. If Tesla does amazing, your Tesla shares do amazing. If Tesla flops, you lose money.

**2. ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)** — a basket of many stocks bundled together. Buying one share of **VOO** gives you a tiny piece of all 500 biggest US companies. Much safer than individual stocks because one company failing barely matters.

**3. Bonds** — you lend money to a government or company, and they pay you interest. Low risk, low reward. Good for when you want stability.

**Quick analogy:** If investing were pizza, stocks are single toppings, ETFs are the whole pizza, and bonds are the bread.`,

- One ETF can hold hundreds or thousands of stocks
- Most have very low fees (0.03%-0.20%/year)

**Why it matters:** Studies show asset allocation explains ~90% of a portfolio's long-term returns. Which specific stocks you pick matters far less than **how much you put in stocks vs. bonds**.

The right mix depends on:
- **Age** — younger = more stocks (can ride out crashes)

- **Risk tolerance** — can you sleep if your account drops 40%?`,

**Resistance** is a price level where sellers repeatedly step in — the stock keeps falling back from that level.

**Why they work:** Psychological. Traders remember past prices. If a stock hit $100 three times and bounced, the fourth time it falls toward $100, buyers pile in expecting another bounce.

**Breakouts** (price pushing through resistance on high volume) are bullish signals — the pressure is resolved.

**Breakdowns** (price falling below support) are bearish — support becomes new resistance.`,

**Key facts:**
- Not all companies pay dividends. Growth companies (Tesla, Amazon until 2024) usually reinvest all profits.
- Mature, profitable companies (P&G, Coca-Cola, Microsoft) return cash via dividends.
- Dividends are declared by the company's board and can be cut or eliminated if the business struggles.`,

- **3-5%** — typical blue-chip (PEP, JNJ)
- **5-7%** — high yield (utilities, REITs)
- **> 8%** — danger zone, often signals trouble

**Payout Ratio** = Dividend / Earnings. How much of profits go to dividends?
- **< 40%** — very safe, lots of room to grow
- **40-60%** — healthy
- **60-80%** — stretched
- **> 90%** — unsustainable (dividend may be cut)

**Yield trap warning:** A 15% yield often means the stock price collapsed because the dividend is about to be cut. High yield ≠ safe.`,

These four words have cost investors more money than any other phrase. Every bubble — dot-com 1999, housing 2007, crypto 2021, AI 2024 — had a story about why the old rules no longer applied. They always did.

**The discipline:**
- History rhymes. Extreme valuations always correct eventually.
- When you find yourself justifying a P/E of 100 with "but growth!" — pause.
- When you hear "it'll never go down" — that's near the top, not the bottom.`,

- **Decentralized** — no government or company can shut it down.
- **Pseudonymous** — transactions are public but linked to wallet addresses, not names.
- **Peer-to-peer** — no middlemen needed.

**Why people like it:** A hedge against money printing, a way to send value anywhere on Earth in minutes, and an asset that can't be confiscated if you hold it yourself.

**Why people don't:** Volatile, consumes lots of energy to secure, no intrinsic cash flow, and price has had 70%+ drawdowns multiple times.`,

**Step 2: Account setup**
- Use strong password + 2FA (authenticator app, not SMS)
- Verify your identity (required by law)

**Step 3: Storage**
- Small amounts (<$1,000): fine to leave on exchange
- Larger amounts: move to a **hardware wallet** (Ledger Nano, Trezor) — a USB device that keeps your crypto offline, immune to hacks

**How to work around it:**
- Wait 31 days before re-buying
- Or buy a similar (but not identical) ETF (e.g., sell VOO, buy VTI — different enough for IRS)

**Sneaky trap:** The 30-day window counts across ALL your accounts, including IRAs. And buying the same stock in your Roth IRA while selling at a loss in your taxable account triggers a permanent loss of the deduction.`,

**How it works:**
1. You have $10,000 of realized gains this year

3. Sell the loser → you now have only $2,000 of net taxable gains
4. Tax saved: $8,000 × 15% = **$1,200**
5. You can re-buy a similar (not identical) ETF to maintain market exposure

**Even better:** If losses exceed gains, up to **$3,000** can be deducted against regular income (with excess carried forward indefinitely). You can permanently reduce your income tax.

**Best practice:** Review your taxable account every December for tax-loss harvesting opportunities.`,
